Title: Plant 'Cis-Acting Regulatory Elements' Prediction Tools
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person('Quentin', 'RiviÃ¨re', email = 'qri@hotmail.be', role = c('cre', 'aut'))
Description: Application implementing the Wimtrap method to predict in different plant species the Cis-Acting Regulatory Elements
  and gene targets of transcription factors. The method inttegrates condition-independent and condition-depentdent genomic features at
  location of motif occurrences and makes use of TF-ChIP data to build predictive models based on supervised machine learning. Condition
  -independent genomic features are typicall the results of pattern-matching, the location on the genome and the conservation of the sequence.
  Condition-dependent genomic features include transcription factor footprints and variables related to the chromatin state.
