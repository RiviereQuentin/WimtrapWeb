# README: each step of the dev files is optional, and you don't have to 
# fill every dev scripts before getting started. 
# 01_start.R should be filled at start. 
# 02_dev.R should be used to keep track of your development during the project.
# 03_deploy.R should be used once you need to deploy your app.

## Fill the DESCRIPTION ----
## Add meta data about your application

## /!\ Note: if you want to change the name of your app during development, 
## either re-run this function, call golem::set_golem_name(), or don't forget
## to change the name in the app_sys() function in app_config.R /!\

golem::fill_desc(
  pkg_name = "WimtrapWeb", # The Name of the package containing the App 
  pkg_title = "Plant 'Cis-Acting Regulatory Elements' Prediction Tools", # The Title of the package containing the App 
  pkg_description = "Application implementing the Wimtrap method to predict in different plant species the Cis-Acting Regulatory Elements
  and gene targets of transcription factors. The method inttegrates condition-independent and condition-depentdent genomic features at
  location of motif occurrences and makes use of TF-ChIP data to build predictive models based on supervised machine learning. Condition
  -independent genomic features are typicall the results of pattern-matching, the location on the genome and the conservation of the sequence.
  Condition-dependent genomic features include transcription factor footprints and variables related to the chromatin state.", # The Description of the package containing the App 
  author_first_name = "Quentin", # Your First Name
  author_last_name = "Rivi√®re", # Your Last Name
  author_email = "qri@hotmail.be", # Your Email
